# FEI-conjecture

The Fourier Entropy-Influence Conjecture is a prominent open problem in Boolean analysis, proposing that the ratio of any Boolean function's entropy to influence is bounded by a universal constant.

This tool allows one to compute the ratio of any function's entropy to influence, and contains scripts to computationally explore the space of symmetric and monotone symmetric Boolean functions in search of informative edge cases.
